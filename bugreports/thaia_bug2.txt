Bug in function play_minion()

Playing the Minion card should increase the number of actions by 1. It appears
that during some editing this functionality was incorrectly commented out on
line 640.

Severity: Low. One part of the action of the card is wrong, but otherwise
correct.

Priority: Low. Problem only occurs if this card is played.
