Assignment 4

After testing against two other students dominion implementations, I did not find
any differences after running over 500 tests. This could indicate that my testdominion.c
does not provide enough coverage to show differences, and the coverage is not very high.

The lack of failures could also indicate that the dominion.c files have not diverged
very much from the original, and I know that this is the case for my dominion.c. This
is what prompted my looking a second alternate dominion.c to test.

Because of the possibility of lack of divergence from the original dominion.c, I do
not think that differential testing is a good approach to testing in this case.
