Discussion of unit testing

A summary of the functions and cards test coverage is below. One of the things
that stands out to me is that the function that executed the most lines, is also
the only function I tested to have failures, buyCard(). This could just be chance,
or it could indicate that functions with more lines tend to have a higher chance of
errors occuring, which is something that we might expect.

I also notice that the coverage for all the cards is the same or similar and the
the cummulative lines covered grows very little. This makes since as I am
executing the playCard() function for all four cards, so only the specifics to
each card changes.
