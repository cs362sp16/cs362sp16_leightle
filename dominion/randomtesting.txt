Assignment 3

For smithy and village, there does not appear to be much change in test coverage.
After going through dominion.c.gcov (included as random.gcov), it does appear that
my tests touch all lines of all three cards.

The only failures appeared in the test for village, which were not caught by the
previous unit test.
