I implemented tarantula using gcov and based off of my randomtestadventurer.

to run:
make tarantula
./tarantula

This displays colored line output corresponding to the suspiciousness of the
line of code. Unfortunately, this did not help very much. Most of the lines run
in both successful and failing tests or don't run for either. While using
tarantula in this case was not helpful, I can see that it may be useful in other
situations.
